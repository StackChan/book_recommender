## About

### Proof of Concept

The recommender system is initially built and tested on Python, see [recommender.py]().

--- figures here: how readers of 25+ books recommend some books to other readers of 5 books, using principle of cosine similarity.

The prototype of the recommender system is presented in Jupyter Notebook, see [recommender.ipynb]().
