This repository contains the final project for the ComIT's FULL STACK .NET course from July 20 to October 21, 2020.


## About

### Proof of Concept

--- figures here: how readers of 50+ books recommend some books to other readers, using principle of cosine similarity.

The recommender system itself is initially built and tested on Python. The prototype is presented in Jupyter Notebook, see [recommender.ipynb](https://github.com/ornwipa/book_recommender/blob/master/recommender.ipynb).
