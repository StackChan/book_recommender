# Project Initialization Document

## Scope

A section of text explaining what will be delivered to the project stakeholders (in this case the instructors). It should explain the use cases of the program and what problem(s) it attempted to solve. It should also include a paragraph outlining what frameworks will be used to develop the application.

## Top Level Design

A brief outline of what the user experience of the final product will be. What user interface will be provided to the user? What interactions with the program include? Does the program contain a backend database? Will it be hosted on the web, or will it be a desktop/mobile application?

## Risks / Unknowns

The student should consider what areas of the project may cause problems for them, and provide detail into how those risks will be addressed.
